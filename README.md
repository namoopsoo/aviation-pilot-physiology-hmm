### Aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm
A look at this physiological data kaggle from [earlier this year](https://www.kaggle.com/c/reducing-commercial-aviation-fatalities/data).

- [More data, less stratifying](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2019-06-16--today.md.ipynb)

- [Test driving TensorBoard](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2019-08-10-c-again.ipynb), which required a much different train loop that stores ouputs from the logits across the training epochs. Very cool.
- [Using h5py](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2019-12-01-batch-train.md) for data now [and plotting my logloss per class](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2019-12-08-.md) .
