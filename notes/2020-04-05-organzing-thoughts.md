### Scaling

[On 2019-12-21](https://github.com/namoopsoo/aviation-pilot-physiology-hmm/blob/master/notes/2019-12-21--update.md) , I ended up trying out more scaling approaches, especially `MinMaxScaler`. I had `8` features I was focusing on at that point and I plotted how my `minMaxScaler` `min` and `max` parameters changed as I processed roughly `40` or so mini datasets I had in my h5 training file `data/2019-12-21T215926Z/train.h5`.
