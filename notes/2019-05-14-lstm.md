#### Quick look at the `time` field here, 
* So the `train.csv` data describes several experiments on several crews I believe.
* At least initially, the time doesn't look sequential,
*  It ends at `99seconds` , but the max `time` is `360seconds`
```python
df = pd.read_csv('data/train.csv')
print(df.time.iloc[-5:].tolist())
#    [99.991005, 99.993004, 99.994003, 99.997002, 99.998001]

df.time.tolist() == sorted(df.time.tolist())
#    False

df.time.iloc[:10].tolist() == sorted(df.time.iloc[:10].tolist())
#    True

df.time.max(), df.time.min()
#    (360.37109375, 0.003)
```



#### Reading LSTM article
* ([this](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) one)
* Also came across [link](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

#### Initial thoughts, 
* not sure if we'll need a bidirectional NN here.
